In this analysis I use Empirical Bayesian techniques to better estimate a boxer's win rate. This technique is especially effective for boxer's who have a very small number of boxing matches under their belt

I scrape 400,000+ trophy fish records from Manitoba and analyze fish catching trends over time, women's involvement in sport fishing, as well as find several hot fish/lake/season combos for catching big fish

I use several machine learning models to predict IMDb episode ratings for Bob Ross' The Joy of Painting episodes

### Probability simulation work

<a href="https://github.com/cookm346/birthday_problem_simulation"><img align="left" src="images/adi-goldstein-Hli3R6LKibo-unsplash_small.jpg"></a> [Birthday problem simulation](https://github.com/cookm346/birthday_problem_simulation) 

I solve the famous Birthday Problem via Monte Carlo simulation

### Statistics simulation work

<a href="https://github.com/cookm346/median_split_simulation"><img align="left" src="images/scatterplot.PNG"></a> [Median split simulations](https://github.com/cookm346/median_split_simulation) 

I show why it is never benefit to perform a median split (and other splits) on a continuous variable. The main issue is a reduction of statistical power in finding effects (i.e., type 1 errors)

<a href="https://github.com/cookm346/t_test_simulation"><img align="left" src="images/histogram.PNG"></a> [t-test simulations](https://github.com/cookm346/t_test_simulation) 

In this brief simulation, I demonstrate the dangers of violating the equal sample size and equal variance assumptions while using the Student's t-test. The Welch's t-test also shows it's impressive ability to correct for assumption violations

<a href="https://github.com/cookm346/eigenfibs"><img align="left" src="images/ludde-lorentz-YfCVCPMNd38-unsplash_small.jpg"></a> [Computing Fibonacci numbers using eigenvectors](https://github.com/cookm346/eigenfibs) 

I show how to represent the algorithm that generates fibonacci numbers as a matrix, then use a linear alegbra method called eigendecomposition to generate any fibonacci number without having to compute the preceding numbers in the series
